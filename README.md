# introduction-to-git

This is my study about Git, is based (more like a copy) on a course of DataCamp "Introduction  to Git".

## What is version control?

Git is one of several version control systems, it's a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. The advantages of Git are:
- You can always see which reults were generated by which versions of your programs
- Git automatically notifies when your works conflicts with another, making difficult eventuals overwrites
- You and many people can work in the same project in different machines, in this way we have greater scalability

So Git keep track of changes to files, notice conflicts between changes made by different people and synchronize files between different computers

## Where does Git store information?

Each Git projects has two parts:
- Files and directories that we create and edit directly
- Extra info that Git records about the project's history
The combo of this these two things is called __repository__

Git stores all of this "Extra infos" in a directory called `.git` located in the root directory of the repository. The way this information should be storage is a very precise way, so never edit ou delete anything in `.git`

If a home directory `/home/repl` contains a repository called `dental`, which has a  sub-directory called `data`, the information about the history of the files in `/home/repl/dental/data` is in `/home/repl/dental/.git` because all of the information about repository is stored under its root directory and `data` is just a sub-directory













para utilizar a função tal
